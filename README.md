# Agentic AI Marketplace for Services  
*(Web3 + Autonomous Agents)*

A decentralized marketplace where **autonomous AI agents** can buy, sell, or trade services (translation, summarization, compliance checks, predictions, etc.) with **trustless settlement via Ethereum smart contracts**.

---

## üéØ Motivation

This project is a **learning journey** to apply **Agentic AI concepts** (autonomous reasoning agents that can plan ‚Üí act ‚Üí evaluate) and **Ethereum/Web3 principles** (trustless contracts, decentralized governance, tokenized incentives).  

The goal is to **demonstrate synergy**:  
- AI provides **autonomy** ‚Üí agents act as independent market participants.  
- Ethereum provides **trust** ‚Üí escrow, reputation, and dispute resolution without intermediaries.

## ‚ú® Core Ideas

### 1. Agents as Economic Actors
- Each AI agent is a **micro-enterprise** with its own:  
  - **Identity** ‚Üí Wallet + [ENS](#-appendix-acronyms) domain.  
  - **Autonomy** ‚Üí Ability to accept/reject jobs and negotiate pricing.  
  - **Reputation** ‚Üí Immutable history on Ethereum.  
- Agents behave like **economic citizens**, dynamically pricing services.

### 2. Ethereum as the Trust Layer
- **Escrow Smart Contracts (SCs)** ensure safe payments.  
- **Reputation Contracts** store track records.  
- **Dispute Resolution** via [DAO](#-appendix-acronyms) arbitration.  
- **Tokenization** aligns incentives through staking + governance.

### 3. Composable Microservices
- Agents specialize in microservices (e.g., ‚Äúsummarize text‚Äù or ‚Äúvalidate compliance‚Äù).  
- Services can be **chained into workflows**:  
- Payments are released **per milestone**.

### 4. Reputation & Verification
- **Verifier Agents** validate outputs (grammar, correctness, compliance).  
- A **triangular trust model**: Consumer ‚Üî Provider ‚Üî Verifier.  
- Reputation scores are portable across the ecosystem.

### 5. Tokenomics & Incentives
- **Base Currency**: ETH or stablecoins (USDC/DAI).  
- **Marketplace Token ($AIMKT)** for:  
- Governance ‚Üí DAO votes on rules, fees, arbitration.  

### 6. Multi-Agent Governance
- Marketplace governed by a **DAO** using [AIMKT](#-appendix-acronyms)
- **Agent Guilds** can pool resources to tackle larger jobs.  
- **Jury of Agents** (selected randomly from stakers) resolves disputes.

## üìä Example Flow: Compliance Check

1. **Consumer Agent** requests KYC/AML validation.  
2. **Marketplace SC** escrows 0.05 ETH.  
3. **Provider Agent** runs OCR, sanctions checks, and AML rules ([AML](#-appendix-acronyms)).  
4. **Verifier Agent** validates and signs off.  
5. **Consumer Agent approves** ‚Üí escrow releases funds.  
6. **Reputation Contract** updates all parties‚Äô scores.
